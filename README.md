## Assess Your Skill Level
The most important step is knowing how you compare to other job seekers. Pinpoint areas where you are weaker, and spend the time necessary to make improvements. Google is your friend.

* **Novice** - You can create an Angular app using angular-cli or other popular project seeds, you have a basic understanding of components, modules, pipes, services, etc. If you don't have a clue what I am talking about, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOr1r1rSZQ8) and get up to speed.
* **Intermediate** - You have a fully functional app that is deployed somewhere and/or published code in github, and you are comfortable with routing, authorization, feature modules, architecture, style guide, etc.
* **Expert** - You have mastered lazy loading, AOT, custom directives, deployment configuration, extending core features, etc.
* **Everyone Else** - You are either angular blind or an angular rock star. 


## Know the Interviewer
Do yourself a favorâ€”Google the interviewer. Look at his/her Linkedin profile. Check his/her youtube videos, crappy old blog that hasn't been updated in years, and github profile. After your research, try to put the interviewer in one of the following categories:
1. Lazy interviewers wil ask about terminology. Sometimes they just Google and ask questions from there. If your interviewer is older and out of touch with the current development landscape, there is a greater chance that he/she will ask questions related to terminology.
2. More modest and nicer interviewers will be interested in what you know and whether you can get the job done. For this kind of interviewer look at the How category questions (I'm unsure what you are trying to say here)
3. Experienced interviewers (those who have been senior developers for a long time and have recently updated blogs and videos) want to know that you can think critically, and he will be interested in your process for decision making. These interviewers love to prove you wrong. One important tip: don't try to prove them wrong.

Researching relevant team members on LinkedIn and github can be useful as well.

## Novice Level

## Coding Test
Sometimes interviewer gives real coding test. Most of us suck on those and feel ashamed of ourselves and then continue to work in the current job. I don't want you to saty in that miserable job. Hence, take the following coding challenges and master them. 

### Fetch Data and Display User Profile

This test has three level
1. Level 1: I am giving you an api https://api.github.com/search/users?q=eric This api takes a query parameter name "q" and passes query string to server. Server returns bunch of users. Now I want you to create a input text box and button so that you can type anything on the text box and hit on the button to retrieve data from the given api. Upon retrieval display total_count and first 10 users in the search result. Detail instruction about this test is available [here](https://github.com/khan4019/github-profile-search)
2. Level 2: Convert each user profile as a router link so that upon clicking on each user profile you will navigate to a route that has "login" property in the route. Pass user.login as route parameter. Create a separate component where you will read the route parameter and then fetch data for that user  by using this api https://api.github.com/users/eric . Please Notice that last part of this api is the user.login (the route parameter that you have passed). Finally display user image and few other information in the component
3. Level 3: use any charting framework that you can find and then create a simple bar chart to display number of followers of first 10 users


This coding test will judge your ability to use services, component, routing, data visualization, external module, observables, etc.

### Persistent Todo List
This test has three levels
1. Level 1:  Implement a simple todo list where you can add items, mark as done
2. Level 2: Now create few categories of todo list and make it persistence in the browser
3. Level 3: Now use firebase (serverless database) to make todo list persistence across multiple devices

This coding test will judge whether you can pass data and events between components. Also, whether you are leveraging directives and understand difference between component and directives.

### Student Registration System
This test has three levels
1. Level-1: Design a system where students can login to register different courses 
2. Level-2: Add a feature so that faculties on each course can view how many students registered on the courses
3. Level-3: (I need a shower. will add text here after I clean up myself) 

This coding test will judge your understanding of architecture for a large application. Your ability to think and implement module, lazy loading, asset management etc.
